# Untyped Lambda Calculus Interpreter
Interpreter for the untyped lambda calculus described in [Types and Programming Languages](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/).

##Capabilities
Currently none, since it isn't finished. The interpreter will be able to parse basic abstractions (lambda statements), variables, and function application.

##Examples
Coming soon.
